This repository collects the basic structure of a repository including source codes, docs and eventually tutorials.

**magnetoHDFoam: OpenFOAM solver for magnetohydrodynamics. Authors:** Matteo Lo Verso, Carolina Introini, Antonio Cammi

This repository collects the supporting code for magnetoHDFoam: an open-source OpenFOAM library for MHD simulations, with a particular emphasis on practical applications within the domain of magnetic confinement fusion. In the coming months, the code files will be published here once the peer-review process of the related paper will be completed.
